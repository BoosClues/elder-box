# Asset notes

This repository avoids committing binary assets. Provide your own high-quality images,
textures, and sounds when integrating the puzzle box.

## Glyphs (3x3 grid)
Required glyphs in order: moon, bat, child, blood, vampire.
Additional glyphs for misdirection: walrus, oyster, bird, sun.

## Texture
An obsidian volcanic glass texture should be supplied for the box surface.

## Sounds
Provide short effects for valve turns, clicks, and telescope mechanisms.
The current implementation synthesizes simple tones via the Web Audio API.
